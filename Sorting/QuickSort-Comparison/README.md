# A QuickSort Comparison

A set of programs which use three approaches to prove which selection of a pivot element in a random array of integer elements would give the best result for the quicksort algorithm.

The three approaches used in the three programs are as follows:
- Choosing the first element as the pivot. (Slowest)
- Choosing the last element as the pivot (Faster but only a little)
- Choosing the median element from the set {array[first], array[middle], array[last]}. (Fastest)
