# Karger's Algorithm to find the Minimum Cut in an Undirected Graph

An algorithm which finds the minimum cut of a graph, that is the smallest number of edges that disconnects the graph into two components.

Kargerâ€™s algorithm is a Monte Carlo algorithm and cut produced by it may not be minimum. Hence, the program might have to be run a number of times until the smallest cut is produced.

To run the program, download the folder. Change the path of the terminal to the folder and compile by typing "make".
To execute, go to the bin directory and type "./MinCut" in the terminal.
For clean up, return from the bin directory and type "make clean".
